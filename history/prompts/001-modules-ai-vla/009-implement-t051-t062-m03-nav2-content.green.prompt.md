## Prompt

## Response snapshot

All content sections for the "Nav2" topic in Module 3 (`docs/module-03-ai-brain/04-nav2.md`), from "Concept Overview" (T051) to "Further Reading" (T062), have been filled. These tasks have been marked as completed in `specs/001-modules-ai-vla/tasks.md`. This marks the completion of all content population tasks for Module 3.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The "Nav2" topic of Module 3 has been fully populated with content, and all content population tasks for Module 3 have been completed, achieving the Suggested MVP Scope.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed for these content tasks.
- 📁 Files: `docs/module-03-ai-brain/04-nav2.md` was significantly modified, and `specs/001-modules-ai-vla/tasks.md` was updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with content population for Module 4, starting with T063.
- 🧠 Reflection: The content generation process is progressing as planned, with each section being filled iteratively.
