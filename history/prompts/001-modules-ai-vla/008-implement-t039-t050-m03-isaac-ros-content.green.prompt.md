## Prompt

## Response snapshot

All content sections for the "Isaac ROS" topic in Module 3 (`docs/module-03-ai-brain/03-isaac-ros.md`), from "Concept Overview" (T039) to "Further Reading" (T050), have been filled. These tasks have been marked as completed in `specs/001-modules-ai-vla/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The "Isaac ROS" topic of Module 3 has been fully populated with content according to the specification.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed for these content tasks.
- 📁 Files: `docs/module-03-ai-brain/03-isaac-ros.md` was significantly modified, and `specs/001-modules-ai-vla/tasks.md` was updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with the next topic in Module 3, "Nav2," starting from T051.
- 🧠 Reflection: The content generation process is progressing as planned, with each section being filled iteratively.
