## Prompt

## Response snapshot

The "Concept Overview" section for the "Course Introduction" topic in Module 3 (`docs/module-03-ai-brain/01-course-introduction.md`) has been filled. Task T015 has been marked as completed in `specs/001-modules-ai-vla/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The first content population task (T015) has been completed, advancing the implementation of Module 3.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed for this content task.
- 📁 Files: `docs/module-03-ai-brain/01-course-introduction.md` was modified, and `specs/001-modules-ai-vla/tasks.md` was updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with the next content population task, T016.
- 🧠 Reflection: The content generation process is iterative. Each content task will involve reading the target file, generating relevant text, and writing it back, followed by marking the task complete.
