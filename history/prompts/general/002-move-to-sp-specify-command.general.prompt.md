## Prompt

The constitutiton is already made so can we move on to sp.sepcify command

## Response snapshot

Based on the CLAUDE.md guidelines, I need to create a Prompt History Record (PHR) for our interaction. I have located the PHR template and will now create a record for our current interaction. I'll now proceed with executing the sp.specify command as requested.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR for current interaction and prepared to execute sp.specify command
- 🧪 Tests:
- 📁 Files: Created history/prompts/general/002-move-to-sp-specify-command.general.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Will execute sp.specify command to create feature specification
- 🧠 Reflection: Following the Spec-Driven Development workflow as outlined in the project guidelines

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
